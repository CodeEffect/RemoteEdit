# Remote Edit #

***THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, IT IS NOT SAFE TO INSTALL***  

A plugin for Sublime Text 3 for editing files over SFTP.

## Details ##

***THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, IT IS NOT SAFE TO INSTALL***  

This is the beginnings of an SFTP editing plugin. It currently should not even be 
considered alpha quality software and is far from complete. The features that it 
does have currently only work on Windows with ST3. It is filled with debugging 
messages, feature imcomplete and likely broken in numerous ways.

Please do **not** let it near files that you care about :)
